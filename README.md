## Journalism in Age of Data - Geoff McGhee (2011)

These two journalists use the principle that vision is the best way for individuals to assess the world around them. Capturing images of the surroundings allow the brain to actually know what is going and understand the information presented. The goal is to use the complicated data given and try to make it look like something the audience can easily relate to. It is more about how it looks like. Data in itself is raw and difficult to see or understand what is happening. Data visualization allows to put the raw data into context. By using graphics, art, charts, etc. the information found in the raw data appears to be easier to understand. 
In the recent years, more and more people give less time to reading long articles containing lots if information. People want to spend as less time as possible still wants to get the whole context of the article. That is why data visualization is being used more often in journalism. But when data visualization is done incorrectly, it can communicate wrong information and change the whole data in the wrong way. 
I personally think that data slideshow is a good way to capture people’s attention. It allows them to go straight to their element of interest on the slide show but at same time they have access to the rest. So maybe comparisons between data from two different years become a little bit easier for instance. Also, I think data visualization gives life to the data with all the sounds, movements, colors, pictures, graphs, etc. also, when data visualization is too hard to understand, it becomes frustrating to the reader, which is something that should be avoided. 
I think data visualization in journalism is the way to go because it is a way of telling a story to the reader that enables him to better understand complicated and/or sophisticated data easily and in a short period of time. It makes it more interesting, useful, and digestible to the readers.
